# Notebooks and miscellaneous code
# ___

These are notebooks (and accompanying materials) I used to perform preliminary investigations,
and some code I wrote while I was waiting for parts delivery that I 
did not end up needing.


I tended to iterate through code versions rapidly and commented plenty of profanity, which I tried my best to clean up so these documents may tell a story.
